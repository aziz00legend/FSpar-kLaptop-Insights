# Computer Characteristics Data Analysis

## Overview

The **Computer Characteristics Data Analysis** project focuses on analyzing and interpreting various features of computer characteristics using advanced data analysis techniques. The project employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means Clustering to identify meaningful patterns and reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, providing valuable insights.

## Features

- **Data Transformation:**
  - Applied data transformations to ensure compatibility for analysis, cleaning, and preparing raw data for further processing.
  
- **Visualizations:**
  - Generated insightful visualizations using **matplotlib** to interpret data trends and highlight key findings.

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
  - Utilized PCA to understand variable correlation structures and reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining essential information.

- **K-Means Clustering:**
  - Implemented K-Means Clustering to group data into clusters based on similarities, followed by PCA to further analyze and identify each cluster's unique characteristics.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and processing.
- **scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms (PCA, K-Means Clustering).
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization.

## Project Duration

- **April - May**

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Imported and cleaned the dataset for analysis.
   - Applied necessary transformations to ensure the data's compatibility for machine learning models.

2. **Visualization:**
   - Created multiple charts and graphs to provide a visual understanding of data distribution and relationships.

3. **PCA Implementation:**
   - Reduced the dataset’s dimensionality by extracting the principal components, making it easier to visualize and interpret the data.

4. **K-Means Clustering:**
   - Classified the data into distinct clusters and used PCA to explain the characteristics of each cluster.
